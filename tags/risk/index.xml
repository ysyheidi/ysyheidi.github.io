      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is a hotspot for economists to discuss and reflect the relationship between risks and competition. Till now there is no consensus among researchers. With the unbalanced panel data of all commercial banks in 20 non-OECD countries over 2000-2014, the article tried to figure out the relationship between competition and risk. Time variant Competition was measured by the Panzar-Rosse H statistics and risk was measured by rolling Z-scores. In the final regression, other macroeconomic index and bank specific factors were considered. Results found that banks` risks level would increase with the increase of market competition while a relatively larger bank would be less impacted by competition.&lt;/p&gt;
