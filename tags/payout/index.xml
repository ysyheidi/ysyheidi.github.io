      <description>&lt;p&gt;This paper intends to research into the chosen company-- Kweichow Maotai Co., Ltd about its characteristics which entitle it to be the leading firm in the white spirit industry within China. Based its general conditions, this paper mainly focus on its capital structure with very leverage ratio and very high liquidity ratio of debt and asset, as well as its payout policy which returns relatively small amount of cash compared to its price back to the investors. Simultaneously we also take the interest conflicts and the competitive scenario with other rivals into consideration. It can be concluded that the financial response of its leverage level and dividend policy is not significant. While the major suggestions given from this paper contend that it should raise more debt when faced with worthwhile investing projects and should increase the dividend yield ratio for the feedback of its investors, which can also reduce its excess cash at hand.&lt;/p&gt;
